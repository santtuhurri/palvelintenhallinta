Modify Harjoitus3.md, try new things with TESTI.md, remove test file koodi.md

# First test

This is my test to find out how markdown works.

## More testing

Is this text under a subheading?

###  Code or not?

	#/bin/bash
	echo "Hello World!"

### Wonder what else I can do with Markdown

*Different* and **different** text.
1) Some listing
2) Maybe more listing
3) And finally more listing

Text that is only partly shown as *code*. Something like this `micro TESTI.md`

Now I am testing that wrapping is on. Because it was quite annoying to do the homeworks when the text did not wrap automatically. Looks like it is working.
